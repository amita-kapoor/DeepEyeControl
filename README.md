Required install:

```
tensorflow
tflearn
```

- Create folder Data/Raw/, Data/Processed/ Models/ and Datasets/

To train the classifier:

```
python main.py train
```

To test the classifier (requires some trivial tweaking in the code):

```
python main.py test
```

- Most editable parameters are in the config.py file, the model can be changed in the model.py file.
- I haven't implemented the end of pipeline (actual commands trigger) but that is straightforward in the classifier.py file.
